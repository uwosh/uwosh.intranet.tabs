Introduction
============

This product will house the implementation of our tabs for the intranet.

A tab is a set of groups of links right now. A tab is a really simple
object that no catalog is connected with. Additionally, our navigation will
be based off the tab concept.

The idea behind all of this is we need this to perform as fast as possible. In
bypassing the catalog and Plone's normal navigation, we're able to accomplish this.

In addition to this, the product will product a intuitive user interface
for `curators` to use to organize their links and find content. This would
ideal contain content browser and search functionality.
